                      Average is the maximum rate, by default in requests/s, allowed for the given source.
                      It defaults to 0, which means no rate limiting.
                      The rate is actually defined by dividing Average by Period. So for a rate below 1req/s,
                      one needs to define a Period larger than a second.

          TLSStore is the CRD implementation of a Traefik TLS Store.
          For the time being, only the TLSStore named default is supported.
          This means that you cannot have two stores that are named default in different Kubernetes namespaces.
